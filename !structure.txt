. -> All of the scripts relevant to the program (.py files),
     that have no other directory specified for them.

libs -> All of the libraries used by the program, either
        containing too many files to put in the parent directory
        or those that have a Cython version.
        All of the libraries that are put here should have
        an __init__.py file, that imports the module.
        This is especially relevant to libraries written in Cython,
        that can be imported in a few ways:
        1. Through the compiled Cython version (.pyd file);
        2. By compiling Cython source (.pyx) on runtime;
        3. By importing the Python source.
        Current libraries:
         * Mazegen (Has Cython version)
